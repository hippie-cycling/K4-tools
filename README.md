**The tools aim to have a single package where the user can do multiple string operations.**
The calculations and operations implemented aim to be simple (doable by hand on paper) and coherent with the author's past and future work and comments.

**Two string calculations:**
XOR (based on 5 bit ASCII). It also supports the main non-reversible boolean operations.
Base 5 mod 26 addition of two strings.

**Single string calculations:**
IoC (English).
Transposition.
Reversion.
Conversion to Morse code.
Conversion and translation of inversed morse ("OBKR = "SJRK").

**VIGENERE BRUTE FORCE ATTACK**
Using a large dictionary of english words, it loops through them until "BERLINCLOCK" "EASTNORTH" or "NORTEAST" is found on the plaintext.
