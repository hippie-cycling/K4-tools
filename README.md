**The tools aim to have a single package where the user can do multiple string operations.**
The calculations and operations implemented aim to be simple (doable by hand on paper) and coherent with the author's past and future work and comments.

**Two string calculations:**
XOR (based on 5 bit ASCII). It also supports the main non-reversible boolean operations.
Base 5 mod 26 addition of two strings.

**Single string calculations:**
IoC (English).
Transposition (TODO: define what alphabet at step)
Reversion.
Conversion to Morse code.
Conversion and translation of inversed morse ("OBKR = "SJRK").

Useful strings.txt for quick copy paste into the GUI.
